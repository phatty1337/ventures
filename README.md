  ```

## 🚨 Example Alert

When an EXP area crosses the alert threshold (default: 90%), you will see:

You will only be alerted once per increase — no spam!

## 🧠 Zoning Detection

If the addon detects that you're zoning (zone ID = 0), it will:

- Skip the current `!ventures` call
- Print a small message: `Zoning detected. Will retry shortly...`
- Retry automatically after 5 seconds

## 🧪 Notes

- Completion is pulled from in-game `!ventures` system

- Does not require any external tools or plugins
